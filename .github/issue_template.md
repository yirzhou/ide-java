A few things to know before you create an issue

* We launch a "language server" process on your machine that understands the language you are editing
* What that server can do - syntax compatibility, whether it supports formatting or outlines etc - is outside of our control
* You can see what the language server supports by checking out our README and following the link after "powered by"

If you understand these constraints, please remove this text and start writing your issue :)
